			<p>G'day mate!</p>
			<p>The name is Reggie, Expert in tracking wild animals. At your service.</p>
			<p>
				In this tutorial you're gonna be learning how to track down elusive animals using <i>RegExp</i> patterns (also
				known as <b>Regular-Expressions</b>).
			</p>
			<p>And here your first challenge - somewhere in this text there's a cat hiding and you ought to find it</p>
			<p>
				For an expert tracker this should take a second, and in real-life this is all you got before the beast will
				pounce at your throat All you need to do is type `<i>cat</i>` between two slashes (<i>/</i>) in the pattern-box
				and this will highlight where the beast is hiding. Give it a go!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-1" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>Finding your first cat wasn't too difficult, wasn't it?</p>
			<p>
				Now let's see if you can find 3 <i>cat</i>s! to do that, you'll need to use the <i>global</i> flag (adding a
				<i>g</i> at the <i>options</i> after the second <i>/</i>)
			</p>
			<p>
				let's see if you can find those kitties (hint: we're not looking for a clowder of cat<b>s</b> but three times
				the word cat appear)
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-2" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>Seems like you're becoming an expert find cats, let's see if you're that good with <i>dog</i>s as well</p>
			<p>
				However dogs come in different sizes - smalls dogs and big DOGs so you'll need to use the
				<i>case Insensitive</i> flag (adding <i>i</i> at the <i>options</i>)
			</p>
			<p>let's see if you can find 3 dogs (don't forget to use the <i>g</i>lobal flag as well!)</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-3" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				Great job finding those dogs but now let's see if you can all <i>cat</i>s and the <i>dog</i>s at the same time
			</p>
			<p>
				The trick is quite simply, honestly, you just need to use the pipe (<i>|</i>) so search for one thing
				<b>or</b> the other. Give it a go!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-4" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				One more challenge before we face you with some really wild animals. A good tracker mustn't confuse a household
				cat from a bobcat because in the outback it's life and death
			</p>
			<p>
				So go ahead and find all the <i>cat</i>s that are just cats. You'll need to use the <b>Boundary</b> symbol
				(<i>\b</i>) to know where the cat's tail ends!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-5" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				Every tracker knows that to find a dingo one must become a dingo, and <i>dingos</i> lives in packs. So now you
				need to find all the dingos, whether they're in a pack or lonely.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure you can look for <i>dingo|dingos</i> but a better way is by adding <i>?</i> after the letter <i>s</i> and
				that would mean the letter <b>might</b> appear once. Try it!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-6" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>Let's play some more with the <i>?</i> metacharacter. Let's see if you can find some roos...</p>
			<p>
				Roos, if you haven't figured it out are <i>Kangaroo</i>s but here in the Outback, where death is lurking, we
				don't have time to say mundane things like "kanga"s
			</p>
			<p>
				If <i>?</i> makes the preceeding character optional, you'll need to use the brackets (<i>()</i>) to make entire
				phrase optional. don't forget roos might come in mobs
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-7" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>Let's see if you can count. You're next task is to track and count <i>wombat</i>s.</p>
			<p>
				To look for number you can either use the <i>\d</i> metacharacter or <i>[0-9]</i> pattern, I'm not being picky
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-8" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				So <i>\d</i> matches any digit (even in foreign languages!) but the grouped range pattern (<i>[0-9]</i>) is also
				useful
			</p>
			<p>Try finding packs of 4-7 coyotes, but not more and not less</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-9" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				You can count to 9. That's fantastic; now let's try counting a bit higher than that. We're now looking for
				<i>koala</i>s
			</p>
			<p>
				Just like the <i>?</i> meant a character is optional, <i>+</i> would mean that the character (or pattern)
				appears at least once.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-10" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				A good tracker can handle whatever is thrown at him, so your next challenge isn't about animals, rather finding
				me phone numbers of two foxy ladies I met last night. They appear here in this paper filled with number but they
				have a very strict format: they always start with a "<b>0</b>" followed by <b>1 or 2</b> digits, space and
				exactly <b>3</b> more digits, another space and then at least <b>6</b> digits
			</p>
			<p>
				You can limit the number of appearances using the `<i>{}</i>` pattern: <i>{x,y}</i> would mean between x and y,
				<i>{x,}</i> would mean at least x and <i>{x}</i> would mean exactly x
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="scene-11" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
			<p>
				Your next task is to find all the <i>tigers</i> including their counts, but this is tricky because there's the
				tiger's description we need to ignore. Essentially the description is anything but a number, so you can use the
				<i>\D</i> to catch anything that is not a digit (and you already know to use the <i>+</i> to catch at least one
				character
			</p>
			<p>
				But it's even tricker because you need to make sure tigers' description is as short as possible (try out to see
				what happens). To make RegExp do a <b>lazy</b> (and not <b>greedy</b>) you'll need to use <i>+?</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if we have "axb ayb" then the pattern <i>/a÷ø\D+b/</i> will match "axb ayb" while
				<i>/a\D+?c/</i> will match "axb"
