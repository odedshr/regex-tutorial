      <p>G'day mate!</p>
      <p>The name is Reggie, Expert in tracking wild animals. At your service.</p>
      <p>In this tutorial you're gonna be learning the <i>RegExp</i> technique (also known as <b>Regular-Expressions</b>) to track down elusive animals.</p>
      <p>And here your first challenge - somewhere in this text there's a cat hiding and you ought to find it</p>
      <p>For an expert tracker this should take a second, and in real-life this is all you got before the beast will run away or pounce at you.
        All you need to do is type `<i>cat</i>` in the regexp pattern and this will highlight where the beast is hiding. Give it a go!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-1" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Finding your first cat wasn't too difficult, wasn't it?</p>
        <p>Now let's see if you can find 3 <i>cat</i>s! to do that, you'll need to use the <i>global</i> flag (clicking the <i>g</i> letter next to the pattern)</p>
        <p>let's see if you can find those kitties</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-2" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Seems like you're becoming an expert find cats, let's see if you're that good with <i>dog</i>s as well</p>
        <p>However dogs come in different sizes - smalls dogs and big DOGs so you'll need to use the <i>case Insensitive</i> flag (the <i>i</i> letter next to the pattern)</p>
        <p>let's see if you can find 3 dogs (don't forget to use the <i>g</i>lobal flag as well!)</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-3" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Great job finding those dogs but now let's see if you can all <i>cat</i>s and the <i>dog</i>s at the same time</p>
        <p>The trick is quite simply, honestly, you just need to use the pipe (<i>|</i>) so search for one thing <b>or</b> the other. Give it a go!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-4" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>One more challenge before we face you with some really wild animals. A good tracker mustn't confuse a household cat from a bobcat because in the outback it's life and death</p>
        <p>So go ahead and find all the <i>cat</i>s that are just cats. You'll need to use the <b>Boundary</b> symbol (<i>\b</i>) to know where the cat's tail ends!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-5" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Every tracker knows that to find a dingo one must become a dingo, and <i>dingos</i> lives in packs. So now you need to find all the dingos, whether they're in a pack or lonely.</p>
        <p>Sure you can look for <i>dingo|dingos</i> but a better way is by adding <i>?</i> after the letter <i>s</i> and that would mean the letter <b>might</b> appear once. Try it!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-6" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Let's play some more with the <i>?</i> metacharacter. Let's see if you can find some roos...</p>
        <p>Roos, if you haven't figured it out are <i>Kangaroo</i>s but here in the Outback, where death is lurking, we don't have time to say mundane things like "kanga"s</p>
        <p>If <i>?</i> makes the preceeding character optional, you'll need to use the brackets (<i>()</i>) to make entire phrase optional. don't forget roos might come in mobs</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-7" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Let's see if you can count. You're next task is to track and count <i>wombat</i>s.</p>
        <p>To look for number you can either use the <i>\d</i> metacharacter or <i>[0-9]</i> pattern, I'm not being picky</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-8" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>You can count to 9. That's fantastic; now let's try counting a bit higher than that. We're now looking for <i>koala</i>s</p>
        <p>Just like the <i>?</i> meant a character is optional, <i>+</i> would mean that the character (or pattern) appears at least once.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="scene-9" class="scene" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>A good tracker can handle whatever is thrown at him, so your next challenge isn't about animals, rather finding me phone numbers of two foxy ladies I met last night. They appear here in this paper filled with number but they have a very strict format: they always start with a "<b>0</b>" followed by <b>1 or 2</b> digits, space and exactly <b>3</b> more digits, another space and then at least <b>6</b> digits</p>
        <p>You can limit the number of appearances using the `<i>{}</i>` pattern: <i>{x,y}</i> would mean between x and y, <i>{x,}</i> would mean at least x and <i>{x}</i> would mean exactly x</p>
